# code-refactor

## Description

the goal of this project was to take an existing websites code and refactor it to make it accessible. when I view the source code, I found many non-semantic elements that were converted to semantic elements (ie; div to main, or div to figure). When I viewed the structure of the HTML elements I found . When I viewed the image elements I found no alt tags; alt tags were then added so that if the image is not displayed the user has alternative information to rely upon. When I viewed the heading attributes I found an instantance of non-sequential order, the footer header tag as h2 doesn't make sense, h4 will make text smaller, and for a footer that is ideal. When I viewed the title element w/ in the head, I did not find a desciptive title; The title was changed so that the text in the browser tab is clear and concise.
